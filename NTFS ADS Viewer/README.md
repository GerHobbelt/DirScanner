# WPF NTFS ADS Viewer	

## Purpose

To test the NTFS ADS (Alternative Data Streams) feature: when you download a file (a PDF, EXE, MSI installer, etc.) an ADS stream will be attached to that filee listing the source URI.

For EXEcutables this is used to signal that these are downloaded and that's how Windows will be able to pop up a warning about this.

For PDFs it is handy to be able to sniff that ADS info and then we can properly populate our Source-URI PDF Document property with it inside Qiqqa.

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.
